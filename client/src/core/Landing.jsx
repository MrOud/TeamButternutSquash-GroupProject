        <p>
          Welcome to the Legends Of Roaming & Exploration (LORE). LORE is
          inspired by the BBS (Bulletin Board Systems) Door Games from a time
          before the internet was ubiquitous. Often BBSes were run by
          individuals who simply kept a dedicated computer connected to a phone
          line - the users of these systems would dial into the computer which
          meant only one person could be connected at a time (well, one caller
          and the local sysadmin) which meant that while door games were a
          multiplayer experience, they were not a shared experience like weâ€™re
          used to with multi-player games today. While LORE does not restrict
          the service to only one user at a time it does focus on the experience
          of the individual player while being a part of a community
